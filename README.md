# Basic-Vulnerablity-Scanner
Every time we set up a server there are a couple of basic vulnerabilities which we need to take care of by adding some configurations on the server. 
Automate the below configs so that setting up a server becomes (almost) as simple as counting 1,2,3!

1. Git source code exposure
2. Removing server version banner
3. Disable directory browser listing
4. Disable trace http request
5. Set cookie with httponly and secure flag
6. Clickjacking
7. xss protection 
8. Disable http 1.0
9. Strong ssl cipher
